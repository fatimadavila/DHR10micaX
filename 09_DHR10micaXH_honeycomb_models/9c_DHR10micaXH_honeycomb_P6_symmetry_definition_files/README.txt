Using the following pdbs are from /9b_DHR10micaXH_honeycomb_dimer_of_trimers/ :
DHR10mica3H_honeycomb_seed.pdb
DHR10mica4H_honeycomb_seed.pdb
DHR10mica6H_honeycomb_seed.pdb
DHR10mica7H_honeycomb_seed.pdb

Repeated process described in /08_DHR10mica5H_honeycomb_model/8c_honeycomb_P6_symmetry_definition_file/README.txt to generate P6 symmetry files for the variable length DHR10micaXH_honeycomb layers

This resulted in:

DHR10mica3H_honeycomb_P6.sym
DHR10mica4H_honeycomb_P6.sym
DHR10mica6H_honeycomb_P6.sym
DHR10mica7H_honeycomb_P6.sym
