DHR10.pdb is a rosetta design model of the DHR10 protein provided by the authors of "Exploring the repeat protein universe through computational protein design" (Brunette et al 2015; Nature 528), which describes DHR10 and other Designed Helical-Repeat proteins

mica4_surface.pdb is a model of the potassium ion sublayer that forms on mica (001) in KCl buffer

In DHR10_on_mica4_surface.pdb these models are combined. The Rosetta protocol makes defined alanine subsititions in DHR10 to allow the negative glutamate residues to interact with the postive K+ ions. The angle of the protein along the lattice is sampled during this step (see /03_DHR10mica18_on_mica001_Ksublayer/3a_globabl_docking_on_potassium_sublattice/)
