This was the orginal model which was observed to be inaccurate. See section 08 for the revised model.


DHR10mica5_p6_monomer.pdb and DHR10mica5_p6_tiling.sym are from /7e_P6_layer_symmetry_definition_file/
DHR10mica5_monomer_Ctrim_38E_0001_1L_0026.pdb is low energy model from /7c_loop_relax//

open DHR10mica5_p6_monomer.pdb and DHR10mica5_monomer_Ctrim_38E_0001_1L_0026.pdb in Pymol

At pymol prompt enter:
super 'DHR10mica5_monomer_Ctrim_38E_0001_1L_0026', 'DHR10mica5_p6_monomer'

Save the superimposed DHR10mica5_monomer_Ctrim_38E_0001_1L_0026 with name: 'DHR10mica5H_tile_p6.pdb'
